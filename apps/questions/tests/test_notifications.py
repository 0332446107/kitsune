# These mails are generated using reverse() calls, which return different
# results depending on whether a request is being processed at the time. This
# is because reverse() depends on a thread-local var which is set/unset at
# request boundaries by LocaleURLMiddleware. While a request is in progress,
# reverse() prepends a locale code; otherwise, it doesn't. Thus, when making a
# mock request that fires off a celery task that generates one of these emails,
# expect a locale in reverse()d URLs. When firing off a celery task outside the
# scope of a request, expect none.
#
# In production, with CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER=False, celery tasks run in a
# different interpreter (with no access to the thread-local), so reverse() will
# never prepend a locale code unless passed force_locale=True. Thus, these
# test-emails with locale prefixes are not identical to the ones sent in
# production.
