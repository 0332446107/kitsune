My primary question is, \"who do I contact about getting access to the Soccoro crash data for Firefox 3.0.0 in a way that I could data-mine it?\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would like to know if anybody here at Mozilla knows anything about similar past, present, or future projects, especially those that deal with the data-mining that Mozilla performs on their own data.  It would be much appreciated if you could point me to a location where I could find this information.\r\n\r\nAlso, any suggestions as to the scope or direction of my research are welcome.  It is not yet as focused as it could be.  I hope that some preliminary data can help me gain focus.  And if further information about the research is required, I will happily provide details to the extent that I can afford.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
